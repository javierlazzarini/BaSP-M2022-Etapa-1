## RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER' PROJECT
The company Trackgenix SA provides software development services to other companies,and has asked us to develop a web system that eases the recording of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team.
In the first week of work, we made a design in Figma of what the different screens of the web app and its functionalities would look like, in order to present Trackgenix.
In this second week, the work was based on converting the previously designed landing page into an HTML document.
After that, in the third week, the index file has been styling using a CSS page to imitate the landing style created in FIGMA.
For the four week of work, i make my landing page to been responsive to diferent resolutions. This can bee open whit a mobile device, tablet or a desktop, and the styles goin to change to show the content adapted.
In the six week, i make the validations to make work the forms of the Trackgenix app web. This ones where validated under the parameters of the company.
For the seven week of work, we added an HTTP request in the forms created in HTML.
The user can find different settings and functionalities like:
- Sign up and Log in for diferent users
