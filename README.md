## RR COURSE - 'BECOME A SOFTWARE DEVELOPER' 2ND WEEK PROJECT
The company Trackgenix SA provides software development services to other companies,and has asked us to develop a web system that eases the recording of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team.
In the first week of work, we made a design in Figma of what the different screens of the web app and its functionalities would look like, in order to present Trackgenix.
In this second week, the work was based on converting the previously designed landing page into an HTML document.
The user can find different settings and functionalities like:
- Sign up and Log in for diferent users
- Management of different roles
- Charge of Reports
